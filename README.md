# 2026-Comp-Bot

This repository contains the code used for the WestCoast Products 2026 [Competitive Concept](https://wcproducts.com/pages/wcp-competitive-concepts).

The project is based on one of CTRE's [Phoenix 6 example projects](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix6-Examples/tree/main/java/SwerveWithChoreo). It uses WPILib [command-based programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html) to manage robot subsystems and actions, a [Limelight](https://limelightvision.io/) for vision, and ~~[Choreo](https://choreo.autos/)~~ [Path Planner](https://pathplanner.dev/home.html) for autonomous path following.

This Specific Repo has changes from 7211 to make the code work for our own version of the WCP concept Bot.
